# Wine Quality Prediction System

## Overview
This project predicts the quality of red wine using the **Wine Quality Red Dataset**, based on features like acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content. Supervised learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, were used to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The **Wine Quality Red Dataset** contains physicochemical properties and quality ratings (3-8) of red wine samples. You can download it from the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

## Technologies
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Data processing)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Data visualization)
  - `scikit-learn` (Machine learning)
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kananashish/wine-quality-prediction.git
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest with ~85% accuracy.
- **Key Factors**: Alcohol and volatile acidity were identified as significant predictors of wine quality.
